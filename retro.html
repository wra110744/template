<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
	<p>From the beginning of the semester, I could already tell this class was going to push me outside my comfort zone. Coming in, I was not the most computer savvy person, and it seemed like this class is going to incorporate technology into many forms of communication. One example was how we used code to post all of our projects online. Learning code was a little difficult for me at the start because I have never seen anything like this, but I quickly started to get the hang of it. Something that motivated me was I knew that if I worked hard to get good enough at writing code, I would bring a valuable asset to any job I may have in the future. </p>
	<p>The first project I was assigned was the Lived Experiences Project. In this essay I had to write in the form of a narrative about a way technology affected my choice of career path. Not only did this project make me think about the many ways technology affects my life, but working on the Lived Experiences Project made me think about different ways to convey information. I was not used to writing in the form of a narrative so it challenged me a bit, but it was not too difficult because I was writing about my own experience in life.</p>
	<p>From this first project, I learned something that will help my writing in the future: write drafts early. Once I got my draft done, I had little to correct after taking advice from proofreaders. I found Eli Review a good resource as it allowed my peers to read, analyze, and critique my writing. I believe that this process occurs often in communication between professionals in the health field, so it was nice to get used to this. During this project, I also published my first essay to the internet using the little amount of code I knew at the time. I still have a lot to learn about code, but it was it is definitely a promising start: it was not too hard and I feel like this will be an invaluable tool to carry with me.</p>
	<p>The next project I worked on, the Cultural Analysis Project, was the largest essay I have had to do so far in college at the time, but it was not too difficult. I picked a topic I am very familiar with and interested in so that made it easy for me. The hardest part was to find ways to tie in every one of my thoughts to the topic and keep it under 2100 words.</p>
	<p>The topic I chose to write about is Miracle, junior hockey, and problems with the college admissions process for junior hockey players. The reason I chose this was because I played junior hockey and realized the difficulty of getting accepted into a good school with only a couple community college credits as a basis for schools to look at. I had good grades and scores in high school, but it took me a couple tries to actually get into college.</p>
	<p>In this paper, I learned to fully express my thoughts about the situation in a non-conflicting way. Writing this paper tested and strengthened my writing skills as I worked to express my ideas about a topic important to me. I had to do this while providing a lot of background information about the topic to a general audience that is most likely not familiar with the systems I was describing.</p>
	<p>The way I chose to write this essay was to lay out most of the background information early on in the introduction, and then proceed to discuss the main issue and ways to resolve this. The background information was very extensive, as it took up almost half of the 2100 word limit, and I was worried I would go over. I had to be concise with my words in the proceeding sections to stay under the limit and express all of my thoughts in an organized manner, but I believe I communicated all of my thoughts on the situation sufficiently.</p>
	<p>This paper not only challenged my writing skills, but it is also challenging my cognitive abilities to define a problem (in this case in the context of a piece of media), analyze it, come up with comprehensive solutions, and predict results, organize these thoughts, and present them in an easy to understand way.</p>
	<p>This project also offered me a new way to format persuasive writing: in the form of a report. I used this report to make the audience both understand the issue and the mindset of one of the players who choose junior hockey over college. From writing in this way, I was compelled to ask myself when I am reading other writings how is this piece trying to influence me. So many things, especially in college are trying to influence thought in one way or another, and to truly understand the material, you need to analyze what each individual rhetoric is trying to push people to believe or understand.</p>
	<p>Overall I found the cultural analysis project to be a growing experience for me and my writing.  The project itself was tough at times and demanded much thought and analysis. It was the first paper I have ever written in this proposal format too. Overall, I was pleased with the result though.</p>
	<p>In week 8 an in class activity introduced me to an invaluable resource I will most likely use as a reference for the rest of my college career. It also refreshed me on finding relevant information in articles, analyzing them, and incorporating it into something bigger. I did all this through MSU’s library’s online database. This website is a massive compilation of articles from different types of literature on almost any topic I could think of.</p>
	<p>I went on to use this resource extensively for my next project. The formal research project was difficult on me because I have not written a research paper in years. Once I was able to think through ad compose my first paragraph, it went smoothly though as I based my paper off the questions that arise from this paragraph. This paper helped me in many ways as I not only learn how information is gathered and distributed in my future career, but I also get the chance to communicate this information in a formal way. </p>
	<p>Once I outlined where my paper was going to go, I had to sort through the findings of research and choose what portions I want to include, as well as try to set up interviews with people and think of questions to ask. I never interviewed someone before this, but I knew that people in the field I want to go into are an invaluable resource. This helped me to get comfortable with asking them questions too. The questions were mostly centered on how research impacts the medical field, and when asking the questions, I was someone relatively unfamiliar with this topic asking experts. When I went on to write the paper, I tried to write it for someone in my shoes only weeks before starting this project.</p>
	<p>I found something I did not expect in the interviews. The process of searching for people to interview was long and hard, but I finally found a few people who could get me in.  I had a list of questions I wanted to ask each individual, but I soon noticed after only a couple questions that the answers I got were not exactly what I expected, and this left me with more different questions relevant to their answers. Moral of the story was to only write up talking points and when interviewing a person, I should try to pick their brain through conversation, not test-like questions. This project definitely has pushed my comfort zone outward and taught me a couple things besides simply material I researched.</p>
	<p>After much hard work on the research project, I was quickly assigned another project.  In this one, I was again required to do something I have never done before: make a documentary. I have never had to make a video for a class, so this was definitely interesting. First thing I had to do was find my group and talk over the possible topics we would make it about. </p>
	<p>This project pushed me to use a form of media much different than printed word to convey ideas and information. It definitely was a challenge, as my group tried to fit a paper we worked weeks on into a 7-9 minute short film. It without a doubt required much collaboration among group members as well as much communication both in front and behind the scenes. I can easily see how this prepared me for classes I will take in the future, as well as in jobs when I join the workforce.</p>
	<p>Around this later point of the semester, I started to get sick of school. This was my first fulltime semester and I really began to realize that college is going to require a good amount of endurance and perseverance. I kept a 4.0 all across the board, but I knew now that this is the most critical time for me to keep pushing forward and not get behind.</p>
	<p>The remix project really showed me what it takes to be successful in a group. I have been required to take initiative and stepped up as the leader in my group. I accepted any help that comes along and gave it praise and thanks, but I also recognized that help cannot be expected necessarily. I did not waste time complaining, but rather I focused on the positives and moved forward towards completing this project to the best of our group’s ability.</p>
	<p>Having an international student in my group was also a good experience. I believe that any opportunity you can work with someone with a much different background than your own is always a great way to really learn something about life. It causes people to cross over both cultural and language barriers to come together and work towards a common goal. Ziqi, having an onlooker’s perspective on the topic of what the documentary was on helped us keep in mind that we need to present this documentary to a neutral audience. This included using commonly understood language, providing insight to hockey player’s mindsets, and trying to get the audience to sympathize with hockey players on the issue. </p>
	<p>While focusing my efforts on finishing the remix project I learned not only about technology by filming and putting these film segments together, but also about communication skills by speaking and choosing important parts to include in this film.</p>	
	<p>I have never been comfortable public speaking, yet I was the person doing most of the talking in this documentary. It without a doubt pushed me out of my comfort zone, but it will only help me in the long run. I was required to show poise during this, and also learned a lot about editing video; editing helped make up for the many things I messed up on.</p>
	<p>This semester I learned a lot about communication that occurs in the health field, both through research and practice. I was required constantly to use different forms to express ideas to different audiences, and this has been very beneficial to me. I learned personally from practicing professionals and researchers the importance of research and communication. I have needed to use creativity and work ethic to build projects to communicate ideas in the forms of paper, web pages, and film. The things I learned from this course will definitely help me in my future, and I will take these skills with me for the rest of my life. Even though it was a lot of work, I am glad I had the opportunity to take this course.</p>
