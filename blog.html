			<h3>Blog Entry 1</h3>
			<p>The video we watched during class was a story in the form of a letter that showed how a nephew is still hurt years after his uncle killed himself. The uncle killed himself because he could not take the suffering his community put on him because of their unacceptance of his sexual orientation. Now, the nephew has found himself in a very similar situation his uncle was in: divorced with kids and gay; however, the nephew’s letter is to tell his uncle that situation isn’t so bad that he had no way out except to take his own life, and that their situation only improves from that feeling of rock bottom.</p>
			<p>In the video, the nephew reads aloud his letter. This is a very emotional scene for the nephew, especially because he has put years of thought and reflection into this letter. Possibly the most important part of this video is at the end, where <a href="http://www.thetrevorproject.org/"> thetrevorproject.org</a>, the website of an organization for suicide prevention, is posted. The nephew hopes that he can prevent another tragedy like the one of his uncle’s death with this video, and he uses the phrase “it gets better” to try to show someone dealing with any issue that could make him think the only way out of his predicament is to take his own life that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
			<p>This message is structured in a relatively informal way as the nephew tells his story, and I believe that I can incorporate some of this informality into my Lived Experiences project to make it less like an essay and more like a narrative.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 2</h3>
			<p>This semester may only be beginning, but I can already tell this class is going to push me outside my comfort zone. I am not the most computer savvy person, and it seems like this class is going to incorporate technology into everything. Setting up all these accounts and knowing I have to stay on top of D2L, Eli Review, and Codecademy and writing is intimidating. I know I am going to have to buckle down, and I think I have what it takes.</p>
			<p>Codecademy has been a little difficult for me because I have never seen anything like this, but I am starting to get the hang of it. There is just a lot of stuff I need to memorize for it, like tags and stuff. I believe that if I work hard though and get good enough at writing code, I will bring a valuable asset to any job I may have in the future.</p>
			<p>Also, working on the Lived Experiences Project has me thinking about different ways to convey information. I am not used to writing in the form of a narrative, but this is not too difficult. This activity has also made me think of how much technology is incorporated into the medical field.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 3</h3>
			<p>I have finished my first paper for this class now, and personally I think I did a good job on it. It was pretty easy for me to do because once I got my draft done, I had little to correct. I have never done anything like Eli Review before, but I think it is a good resource to help correct other papers. Some needed more help than others though.</p>
			<p>I am surprised I already know how to use code to put information like my essay up online. It was not too hard, and I feel like this will be an invaluable tool I can keep in my toolbox. I know I still have a lot to learn though, but it is definitely a promising start.</p>
			
			<h3>Blog entry 4</h3>
			<p>The cultural analysis project has been by definitely the biggest assignment I have had to do in college so far, but it is coming along pretty well. I have picked a topic I am very familiar with and interested in so that is going to make it easy for me. I just am going to need to find ways to tie in every one of my thoughts to the topic and keep it under 2100 words.</p>
			<p>The topic I am choosing to write about is Miracle, junior hockey, and problems with the college admissions process for junior hockey players. The reason I chose this is because I played junior hockey and realized the difficulty of getting accepted into a good school with only a couple community college credits as a basis for schools to look at. I had good grades and scores in high school, but it took me a couple tries to actually get into college.</p>
			<p>I hope in this paper, I can fully express my thoughts about the situation in a non-conflicting way. This paper is going to test and strengthen my writing skills as I work to express a topic important to me while conveying a lot of information about a topic many people are not completely familiar with.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 5</h3>
			<p>In my cultural analysis paper I now have most of the background information written out, and now I can start discussing the main issue and ways to resolve this. I am hoping I am going to be able to wrap it all up under 2100 words because my first two sections alone were about half of that, and I still have four sections to go.</p>
			<p>I have completed the outline of where the rest of this paper is going, and I can tell it is going to be difficult to address every part of the issue in the depth I would like to. This is because the issue is pretty far reaching, but I am going to have to communicate how Miracle connects with the issue, and offer well thought out ways to go about solving this issue. Not only is this paper challenging from a writing perspective, but it is also challenging my abilities to define a problem (in this case in the context of a piece of media), analyze it, come up with comprehensive solutions, and predict results.</p>
			<p>This project is so extensive that it offers me a new way to format persuasive writing: in the form of a report. I can use this report to make the audience both understand the issue and the mindset of one of the players who choose junior hockey over college. By writing in this way myself, I am now compelled to ask myself when I am reading other writings how is this piece trying to influence me. So many things, especially in college are trying to influence thought in one way or another, and to truly understand the material, you need to analyze what each individual rhetoric is trying to push people to believe or understand.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 6</h3>
			<p>After much work, I am finally finishing up the cultural analysis project, and I have found it a growing experience for me and my writing.  The project itself has been tough at times as it has demanded much thought and analysis. It is the first paper I have ever written in this proposal format also, so that was something different. Overall, I am pleased with the result though.</p>
			<p>When I was proof reading papers on Eli, something I found was a couple of the people I proofread for did not follow the assignment sheet at all. They wrote in ways that did not address what this assignment said to, so that made me look back at my paper and make sure I am following the objectives even more closely.</p>
			
			<h3>Blog entry 7</h3>
			<p>This week, an in class activity introduced me to an invaluable resource I will most likely use as a reference for the rest of my college career. It also refreshed me on finding relevant information in articles, analyzing it, and incorporating it into something bigger. I did all this through MSU’s  library’s online database. This website is a massive compilation of articles from different types of literature on almost any topic I could think of.</p>
			<p>I am going to definitely have to use this for my next project. The formal research project is definitely going to be difficult on me because I have not written a research paper in years. At least a sample opening paragraph was pretty well outlined. I am going to base my paper off of this and answer questions that arise from this paragraph.</p>
			<p>This paper is further going to help me in many ways as I not only learn how information is gathered and distributed in my future career, but I also get the chance to communicate this information in a formal way. </p>
			<h3>Blog entry 8</h3>
			<p>As I have the outline of my paper finished up, I now look to what exactly I need to do next on finishing this paper. I need to sort through the findings of research and choose what portions I want to include, as well as try to set up interviews with people and think of questions to ask. I have never interviewed someone before, but I know that people in the field I want to go into are an invaluable resource. This will help me to get comfortable with asking them questions too.</p>
			<p>I have been doing Codecademy pretty consistently until these last couple weeks, and I need to get back on track with it. With so much to do between all of my classes, it is easy to put aside some stuff that is not immediately due, but I know I should get back on track with it. To do this, I am starting to better manage my time and refocus my attention away from some distractions like the internet and TV. I am glad I am realizing what it takes this early before any major damage has been done.</p>
			<p>This upcoming week will involve a lot of work getting this paper done, but I am getting comfortable in this routine and knowing what is required of me every day. I have no doubt that by keeping this up I will be on my way to a 4.0.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 9</h3>
			<p>I found myself in a little bit of a panic after checking Eli review to see I did not submit my paper for review to the teacher. I finished everything, but failed to see a button to press to turn it in. I was pretty mad until I found that my grade was not affected though. In the future I will have to be more careful, I guess.</p>
			<p>I also found something I did not expect in the interviews. The process of searching for people to interview was long and hard, but I finally found a few people who could get me in.  I had a list of questions I wanted to ask each individual, but I soon noticed after only a couple questions that the answers I got were not exactly what I expected, and this left me with more different questions relevant to their answers. Moral of the story was to only write up talking points and when interviewing a person, I should try to pick their brain through conversation, not test-like questions.</p>
			<p>This project definitely has pushed my comfort zone outward and taught me a couple things besides simply material I researched.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 10</h3>
			<p>After a hard week of writing and finishing the research project, I am now onto my next project. In this one, I will again be doing something I have never done before: make a documentary. I have never had to make a video for a class, so this will definitely be interesting. I am going to have to find my group and talk over the possible topics we will make it about. I am grateful this is not something we are doing on our own. </p>
			<p>This project is going to push me to use a form of media much different than printed word to convey ideas and information. It will definitely be a challenge, as my group tries to fit a paper we worked weeks on into a 7-9 minute short film. It will without a doubt require much collaboration among group members as well as much communication both in front and behind the scenes. I can easily see how these things will prepare me for classes I will take in the future, as well as in jobs when I join the workforce.</p>
			<p>I am at the point of the semester where I am starting to get sick of school. This is my first fulltime semester and I am really realizing that college is going to require a good amount of endurance and perseverance. I currently have a 4.0 all across the board, but I know now that this is the most critical time for me. I need to keep it up.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 11</h3>
			<p>The remix project is really showing me what it takes to be successful in a group. I have been required to take initiative and stepped up as the leader in my group. I am without a doubt going to accept any help that comes along and give it praise and thanks, but I also need to recognize that help cannot be expected necessarily. I am not going to waste time complaining, but rather I will need to focus on the positives and move forward towards completing this project to the best of our group’s ability.</p>
			<p>Having an international student in my group will also be a good experience. I believe that any opportunity you can work with someone with a much different background than your own is always a great way to really learn something about life. It causes people to cross over both cultural and language barriers to come together and work towards a common goal, and this process is often a great time to look inward and examine your own culture and beliefs as well as realize there are so many different environments and cultures people around the world thrive in.</p>
			<p>I am familiar with working with international students because the high school I went to was a prep school with almost one fifth of the students from another country. I always welcome these experiences with open arms because I believe it is a chance to really grow as a person through accepting the diversity that is humanity.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 12</h3>
			<p>This week my group is focusing its efforts on finishing the remix project. I am learning not only about technology by filming and putting these film segments together, but also in my communication skills by speaking and choosing important parts to include in this film.</p>
			<p>I have never been comfortable public speaking, yet I am going to be the person doing most of the talking in this documentary. It is without a doubt pushing me out of my comfort zone, but it will only help me in the long run. I am going to have to show poise during this, but hopefully editing will help make up for things I mess up on.</p>
			
			<h3>Blog entry 13</h3>
			<p>After a little bit of technical difficulty, my group’s remix project is finally finished well ahead of when it’s due.  I am finally starting to wrap up the semester, and I am feeling well about my progress. From working on the retrospective project, I have had the chance to look back at much of the work I have done, and I have examined how I have grown in knowledge of communication in the health field, as well as in the field itself.</p>
			<p>I have signed up to work in the cultural analysis group for the final project. I will be working alongside 3 other people to try to organize what parts of people’s papers to include on the final website. I chose this because I have done much work this semester with my cultural analysis project, and I am proud of that essay especially.  We may have not communicated much just yet about this project, but this week I will try to get the group together to talk about ideas and how we are going  to split up the work.</p>
			<p>I am excited to finally be wrapping up in this class and this semester. I have done a lot of work and learned a lot over a wide variety of topics in this class especially. I have also seen what it takes to be enrolled full-time at the university level, and I will continue to keep up the hard work.</p>
			<h3>Blog entry 14</h3>
			<p>This semester I learned a lot about communication that occurs in the health field, both through research and practice. I was required constantly to use different forms to express ideas to different audiences, and this has been very beneficial to me. I learned personally from practicing professionals and researchers the importance of research and communication. I have needed to use creativity and work ethic to build projects to communicate ideas in the forms of paper, web pages, and film. This course will definitely help me in my future, and even though it was a lot of work, I am glad I had the opportunity to take this course.</p>
			<p>Something I would tell anyone taking this class next semester would be to keep on top of stuff. By staying on schedule, you manage time wisely and can put your best work into every project. This is what I discovered this semester: I have to set weekly goals of stuff I need to get done and a little work ahead.  This allowed me to get papers done early enough that I did not need to worry about anything except editing and correcting them the week before they were due.</p>
			
			<h3>Blog entry 15</h3>
			<p>The Chrysler Eminem add centers around the idea that Detroit is a city that has had a relatively tough go and is not nearly as alluring as other big cities in America. Especially recently with the recession, Detroit has faced rough times with high unemployment and crime rates. It taps further into this strategy as it characterizes the city and the auto workers as blue collar and rough around the edges. These “tested in the fire” type metaphors provoke thought about who it is who makes the cars we drive, while promoting the Chrysler 300 to be as tough and durable as the city these cars are made in and the people who make these cars, while also being luxurious. This commercial effectively conveys these ideas to make the car more appealing.</p>
			<p>By including Eminem and his song, “Lose Yourself,” this commercial, it goes further into the idea of Detroit being a tough, hardworking city. The song “Lose Yourself” is about a person trying to do his best with his talents to catch a break into the tough world of music in order to earn enough money to support his family. This idea goes hand in hand with the blue collar attitude put forth in this commercial. Many people would most likely regard Eminem as a tough individual as he has been through a lot and worked hard to become what he is; the fact that he is from Detroit helps draw even more connections between him, his song, and this vehicle.</p>
			<p>“Imported from Detroit” is another great line used in this commercial. It acknowledges that many people seek foreign sources for luxury vehicles, but it also ties the toughness and resilience of this car to the aspect of how it is a luxury vehicle. This line clearly says that this domestic vehicle is just as good, if not better, than imports.</p>
