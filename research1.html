			<h1>Research and Communication in Human Biology</h1>
			<p>This report is being made to serve the purpose of examining the function of research in the field of human biology while showing how ideas are communicated and displaying technology’s role in the transmission of data, research, and ideas in this field. To start, the field of human biology is a very broad discipline that is primarily focused on incorporating scientific foundations, such as genealogy, biochemistry, and molecular biology, into medical practice, research, public policy, and other health applications. A perfect example of how human biology builds a specifically human aspect on the essence of another science can be seen in our understanding of evolution’s role in shaping our bodies and the roles mutations in humans, viruses, and bacteria play into health and disease (Dybas). Research plays an integral role in the field of human biology. Our understanding of these sciences in correlation to human health relies not only on the continuous development of our knowledge through research, but also continuous development of more insightful research methods (Gohlke and Portier). New findings are constantly surfacing, and old information previously heralded as fact often is discredited. Many professionals involved in this field are required to constantly be reeducated as a result of this constantly emerging new information, and they participate in the process of research both by investigating newly published findings and possibly reporting their own findings. This research needs to reach an audience of everyone active in this field through communication, and such communication can be seen in a variety of forms. Findings are often published in magazines or professional journals, on websites, in textbooks, at conferences, or simply by word of mouth. Technology extends beyond just the aspect of communication, however; technology is crucial in human biology as it infiltrates every aspect of this discipline. Technology is used in everything from education as a broad means for communicating information, to research and practice in the form of many tools, screening and measuring devices. Overall, research in human biology is not only for finding new information of this discipline, nor is technology just a means for communicating information, but research, technology, and communication are vital organs to the body of this field because it would be dead without these facets.</p>
			<p>Human biology, as defined by Michigan State University’s bachelor program in this field, is based on the interrelationships within a wide range of biological sciences and how they contribute to the broad study of human health. As one might expect, the core curriculum of this program is very heavily based biological sciences, but it also has classes that aid in the understanding of biology. These include prerequisites that sciences are built on, such as calculus, physics, and chemistry, and also classes that are integral to the discussion and transmission of scientific findings, for instance writing. Once these fundamentals are established, the curriculum delves into many deeper aspects of biology, human health and the connections between a wide variety of health sciences including virology, genetics, neurobiology, and immunology to name a few (Undergraduate Degree- Human Biology). The overall goal of this very widespread field is to intertwine applications from these various sciences to improve human health. This can be done by professionals in this field by one of two means: providing healthcare or researching new frontiers to improve health. Research in this field is as far reaching as the many sciences it encompasses. Providing healthcare is done in a multitude of ways also, as the medical field essentially has a branch for treating every type of illness and even has branches focused directly on preventing illnesses. Professionals in this field include medical doctors and their assistants such as physician assistants and nurses, medical imagers, and of course researchers in the many biological disciplines. Because of the many researchers in this field, new information is constantly being found. This information often builds on scientific understandings, but sometimes a rare finding topples previously held beliefs. The impact of research, no matter how large or small the findings, is nevertheless constantly reshaping the field of human biology as new health care treatments are being discovered and old ones are being improved or completely scrapped.</p>
			<p>Discussions of how research among many sciences affects healthcare and also public policy can be seen in the article The Forest for the Trees: A Systems Approach to Human Health Research by Julia M. Gohlke and Christopher J Portier. This piece from a scholarly journal is most likely directed towards researchers and students in this field, as it addresses how research of human biology and medicine is conducted while offering solutions in ways to redirect research in order to gain more health benefits from it. This piece begins by talking about how there are two major aspects in the current state of health research: outside forces, such as social and environmental, which are examined in how they contribute to disease, and possible treatments for disease, such as medical, therapeutic, or traditional methods, are examined. These research methods involve many different sciences often being incorporated together. A prominent example given in this text is using environmental and social sciences to predict microbiological effects on pathology and genetics. The central argument in this document is that not enough research is going towards methods of preventing diseases by controlling or even eliminating controllable factors that are known to cause majority of human diseases. Money for research is not as frequently directed towards these types of studies due to the fact that curing is more lucrative than preventing. With the examples given in this text, it is obvious to see the vital importance of research among the sciences in the field of human biology, but this text also demonstrates communication’s major role in the field. Communication in the field of human biology is not only necessary in the transferring of information from research, but it also plays the role of broadening the horizon of research and healthcare by sharing ideas of ways to enhance research by making it more efficient and practical. Overall, this piece provides a great look into how research and communication are crucial pieces to the field of human biology (Gohlke and Portier).</p>
			<p>Another article that shows great insight into the workings of the field of human biology is Are human behavior and culture products of our biology? by Vincent Kiernan. This article from a trade journal looks at much research as it asks a deep yet controversial question: are people’s actions predestined due to genes and evolution? Evolution has shaped every creature’s genes, even human’s, and these genes influence every type of bodily function. In genes, bodies are coded in how to grow properly to have functioning systems so that they can eat, breath, think, move, support itself, transport fuels within itself, fight infection, react to danger, and pass these genes onto the next generation through reproduction. Genetic code also impacts the body’s use of hormones and neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters, such as dopamine or oxytocin, influence any range of feelings such as happiness and affection and also play roles in addictions and aggressiveness. Hormones function as messengers between tissues, and these can influence both autonomic functions such as heart rate or storing fuel from foods as well as somatic functions, or voluntary actions, such as sexual behavior. This article uses the science behind bodily functions to demonstrate how researchers have come up with biological conclusions for common human behaviors, and it indicates there could possibly be scientific reasons to explain many more human behaviors. For example, research suggests a correlation country’s tendency towards war and the amount of young male inhabitants. This text also refers to a hypothesis that motherly behavior is a hereditary behavior rooted in genetics and a result of the levels of oxytocin in the bloodstream. This article goes on to talk of how behaviors that are useful and supportive of survival tend to be easily explained by scientific means, but it seems to show some skepticism as science tries to find reasons behind some of the more insignificant human behaviors such as how people wear their hair. It appears that this article is directed more towards a general population than the previous one, as it tends to talk from the perspective of a bystander to science. This article does provide a good perspective of how research is used in this field, though; it shows how research is used to find information, come to conclusions, and form new questions about how to apply newly found information. While research of human biology might not be quite able to predict and explain every single action of ours, it is making strides to improve health so people can continue their unpredictable lives for many years to come (Dybas).</p>
			<p>Not only are there are many sciences studied in the vast field of human biology, but there are also many ways to study and research each science and their interconnections with other sciences. As researchers go about gathering new information, they have a plethora of options to choose from in terms of how to conduct their studies. A few examples of these methods include blind and double blind experiments, case studies, epidemiological studies, intervention studies, and laboratory studies. Researchers seeking to see how something affects a random group of people can conduct a blind experiment- a study where the subjects do not know whether they are actually being tested on or not- or even double blind experiments in which neither the researcher nor the subjects know who is being tested in order to avoid researcher bias. Research on a particularly interesting circumstance of an individual is called a case study, and these usually take place in a clinical situation. Epidemiological studies are used when a researcher wants to gain understanding on why a particular population often experiences certain diseases or lack of diseases. Similar to epidemiological studies, intervention studies are of a population, but they observe what happens as a controlled change is introduced. Finally lab studies are those which are monitored closely with high control in order to try to indicate singular causes for certain responses (Sizer and Whitney 14-15). Each of these types of research has their own benefits and downfalls, so what type is used is dependent on what exactly the researcher wants to measure. As new information constantly comes out and is easily shared with technology like the internet, potential opportunities in research continue to grow at an alarmingly fast rate as other researchers are needed to try to duplicate and confirm results, and researchers wish to build on each other’s findings. Every precept held in this field is a result of some type of in depth research, and all the knowledge that goes into the practice of healthcare can be traced back to research at some point. This is why research is so important and central to this field. As a new generation begins to study human biology, research will need to be a top priority as scientists in this field begin to lock their targets on finding cures to some of the world’s most dreaded diseases, like cancer and AIDS. As mentioned in the article The Forest for the Trees: A Systems Approach to Human Health Research current research methods are not a perfect system:
“In the United States, this result is not surprising considering that > 50% of National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported grants have principal investigators at medical schools, traditionally focused on addressing disease paradigms and therapeutic solutions, whereas approximately 2% of NIH-supported grants have principal investigators in schools or public health, traditionally focused on addressing population risks. Finally, the most cited medical research is increasingly funded by industry, highlighting the impact of current market forces, which provide large financial incentives in the search for therapeutic solutions (Gohlke and Portier).”
Even though research is directly focused towards improving healthcare across the world, people’s health is not always the top priority, visible in the example of some corporations sponsoring researchers to discover a new treatment that they can patent to earn a profit. Research in the field of human biology will continue to shift until its main goal of improving health all around is prioritized; then  the world will see healthier conditions, healthier people, and hopefully someday prosperity worldwide.

			<p>As imperative as research is to human biology, it would be no where without the ability to communicate results. Communication is vital to this field as without it this science could go nowhere. When research is done, information is first compiled, analyzed, and once definitive conclusions are drawn, these findings are communicated to others in a number of ways. Types of communication include the internet, seminars and various publications such as scholarly journals, textbooks, and professional and trade journals. When information is communicated to other people, it can be retested to see if the findings are universal or simply circumstantial. When these conclusions are found to be conclusive fact, if any opportunity is present, scientists can try to find a way to advance current methods of healthcare procedures and treatment with this new found information; therefore, without the facet of communication, human biology and human health would be motionless and never able to improve. The various types of communication all serve different purposes and are directed towards different populations. Most often communications directed towards the general, non practicing/researching audience find their ways into general magazines, newspapers, and comparable websites. Publications like trade or scholarly journals are intended to be read, critiqued, analyzed, and sometimes even retested by professionals or people with a deeper understanding of what is being discussed. Communications often act as readily dispensable information that can be used by a doctor to compare symptoms, provoke thought in a student, or keep the public informed. Anyone researching the field of human biology does not need to look too far to see the vast role that communication plays into the field because it is likely where one would begin his search.</p>
			<p>Recently I had the privilege of interviewing a few people involved in the field of health and human biology, and the results were what one might expect for such a vast field. One individual is a researcher studying the effects of a motivational computer software on compliance with medical treatments, one is a practicing medical doctor, and another is a teacher at Michigan State University and a practicing clinical dietitian. All three agree that research is integral to the health field as it has a well established place in improving peoples overall health with new findings. The researcher seemed to believe that new information from research comes around often, but only substantial findings tend to develop into new treatments (Kucemba). The dietitian held a completely differing stance on how often research affects people’s overall health, as she said that new information comes about daily and each finding significantly shapes the current understanding and practice of healthcare (Martinson). The medical doctor’s stance was somewhere in the middle of the dietitian’s and the researchers, as she said that some areas are frequently changed by research and others are more firmly founded (Verardi). Because the field of human biology encircles so many different subfields, it makes sense to see these differing viewpoints at any time as one subfield may be experiencing a gold rush of new findings from research. In addition to research, all of these people also find communication and technology to be key institutions in this field also. They all seek new information from a variety of sources (peer review journals, textbooks, seminars, discussions with fellow experts, and even magazines directed towards the general population to name a few). It is not surprising to find that people of such different positions in this field are all impacted by research and communication as it is the standard procedure for discovering new findings.</p>
			<p>Not only from talking with people involved in this field is the importance of research and communication evident, but it can also be seen from simply reading articles directed between members of this field. Human biology and health are studied to improve the lives of everyone on earth, and constant breakthroughs in this field give our society better healthcare options daily. Just as important as the ways to finding these breakthroughs is the transmission of this information because when many bright minds can analyze new findings, new thoughts and ideas that build on these findings are inspired. Because the field of human biology is an intertwined network of many sciences for the functional purpose of improving health, there are seemingly infinite research opportunities, and as these opportunities are continually explored, the potential of human biology and health sciences are limitless.</p>
