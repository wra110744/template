		<h1>How Technology Helped Me Choose My Career Path</h1>
		<p>Technology affects literally everything that we do on a daily basis. It affects us so much that it would be impossible for us to list every type of technology we encounter in a day unless we were to spend the day in the woods with nothing besides our clothes. Every single manmade object, of which we daily encounter by the thousands, has much technology imbedded into it. Electronics are a compelling example of the innumerous technologies that are used to make our modern world. Every part of an electronic reflects some type of specialized technology that performs an individual function, and many different types of technology are used to make each of those parts: from the technology used to mine and extract the metal to the technology that installs the finished part into the final product, even the smallest parts of the things that make our modern world modern are filled with technology. Living in an age so filled with technology, it is impossible for us not to be impacted by it in some way. One technology in particular that has helped me more than anything in discovering my future career path is the computer.</p>
		<p>I feel very fortunate to have always had a computer in my home while I was growing up. When I was young, my family had an encyclopedia programmed on our computer. Driven by my curiosity, I would spend hours on end learning about all sorts of things in the world, mesmerized by everything from history, art, religion and science. Science was especially interesting to me, and I was particularly amazed by the concept of the unknown in our natural world. Still today I find the concept astounding that humans have been on this planet for thousands of years and we still have so many questions left to answer and discoveries to make. Outside of our world we have an infinite amount of possibilities of places to explore in space, yet we still have never explored the deepest parts of the rainforests or the depths of the oceans. Our society has scientists exploring everything from the largest to the smallest perceivable parts of the natural world and still constantly making new findings. The most intriguing part of this to me is the vast amounts of medical discoveries that have occurred only in the last century. I find it ironic that we still have so much to learn about the way our bodies work, the thing that we literally could do nothing without, and I am very motivated to help with finding new discoveries because of the possible life saving effects new medicine may hold. When I was young I witnessed my parents suffer with three major health problems between the two- cancer, severe burns, and a mental illness- and, with my curious personality, often turned to the computer and internet for answers to my questions about these conditions. </p>
		<p>While learning about all the different types of treatments doctors can choose from for these conditions, I would ask myself if there could possibly be faster and more effective treatments for these and all other types of diseases and injuries. As scientists continue to make new discoveries, it very well may be the new doctors and scientists today involved in medical research who will be able to answer those questions of mine. The experience of the help doctors provided to my family and my curiosity and my research about sciences has pushed me toward a career path in the medical field. I was inspired by the how skillfully the doctors used their knowledge when treating my parents, and I knew that it must have taken them much time and research to gain such insight. Even today I often use the computer and internet to research particular parts of medicine as I begin to narrow down which branch interests me most.</p>
		<p>Something I have personally noticed about my future profession is that computers and medicine seem to go hand in hand. With the vast amounts of available information and data online, most doctors use computers and the internet as a resource in discerning among diseases and treatment plans when treating patients. My primary care physician, for example, always has a tablet on him during checkups. Perhaps it is a good sign that I have used a computer as a tool to help me discern my medical vocation, because computers are the focal point in medical technology.</p>
		<p>In addition to the research and recording uses for computers in the medical field, I have also seen this piece of technology impact a close family member of mine with its unlimited potential as a communication tool. One of my family members has a genetic heart condition, so she has an emergency defibrillator and heart monitor implanted in her chest. Instead of needing to constantly go to the cardiologist for constant checkups for monitor readings, she has a reader connected to the home phone line that sends signals to her doctors to make sure her heart is functioning normally. I am not sure if there are other medical devices and technologies that operate in such a way, but this technology shows a promising frontier for many people with chronic conditions. Thinking about these types of possibilities is very exciting to me because technology that has become very commonplace in our world still has many untapped functions that, to their fullest extent, can help people enjoy many extra years of life.</p>
		<p>While my current long term goal is to graduate from medical school and become a doctor, I am not going to count out any future possibility of me designing medical devices: if I ever come across any way to make a process easier, safer, or more patient oriented by creating a new technology, I would feel blessed to use that opportunity to help the entire field of medicine. The encounter I had in my family with how medical technology can make life incredibly easier for patients especially inspires me to look into incorporating more technology into medicine. My short term goal is much more in my immediate sights, and it still involves the same technology I used to find my career path and will constantly use when I finally start my career. For now I am focused on earning my bachelorâ€™s degree, and here at Michigan State University that process requires extensive computer use to assist in my learning and the sharing of my ideas with this educational community. In my first semester at this university, all of my classes require me to use the internet in addition to lectures in order to learn and be assessed on the material, and I assume this is how it will be for the rest of my years in college also. Computers and the internet are yet again assisting me on my career path by contributing to my higher education.</p>
		<p>The aspect of available knowledge the internet provides absolutely amazes me, and it has helped me very much in my young life. I have learned vast amounts of factual knowledge from it, as well as getting guidance from the lessons of people who have gone before me. For now, I am on a path of bettering myself through learning so that I can do the job I believe I am being called to do, and I will need the help of my professors, my peers, and also technology to get me to where this path leads. In the future, when I gain my own knowledge and experience of the medical field, I plan on giving back to the resource that has helped me so many times by sharing my insight with those who share similar paths as I do. The technology of computers has constantly shaped my life and will continue to shape it as I become the doctor I wish to be.</p>
