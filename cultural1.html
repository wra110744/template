			<h1>Miracle and Junior Hockey</h1>
			<h5>Executive Summary</h5>
			<p>Very few artifacts in popular culture can depict the hockey community better than the 2004 movie Miracle. This movie about the remarkable 1980 Olympic gold medal win by the United States has been both an inspiration for a generation of youth hockey players and a very accurate, in-depth portrayal of what it is like to play hockey. Perhaps one of the most influential parts of this movie is the way that it captures the lifestyle of American college hockey: the Olympics banned professional athletes from participating in hockey until 1988, so the United States’ 1980 team was composed entirely of college players who did not yet sign professional contracts (Olympics). The riveting storyline of Miracle has greatly endorsed the goal of playing college hockey to thousands of American hockey players as it depicts college hockey as the pinnacle of achievements a hockey player can ascend to.</p>
			<p>In most circumstances, players aspiring to play college hockey are required to go through a process that is unparalleled in other collegiate sports, excluding baseball.  Ice hockey is a sport that has very unnatural movements (skating, shooting, and puck control, for example, entail much more complex motions than do running, kicking/throwing, and carrying), so many players need to develop these intricate skills more extensively after high school before they can play at the college level. There is a level of hockey called junior hockey that acts both as a scaffold for elite high school players to continue their development and as a bridge between the high school level and higher levels as it exposes these players to scouts from both collegiate and professional teams. Junior hockey is a system of many different leagues across the United States and Canada of the Under 20 age group that all have the common goal of promoting their players, and most junior hockey players, unless still in high school, either completely take time off from school or attend community college part-time in order to focus their efforts exclusively on hockey and comply with NCAA regulations. Except for rare instances, NCAA Division 1 hockey teams are completely composed of players who have junior hockey experience. Nevertheless, the choice of playing junior hockey comes with some inherent risks: many players are often not scouted after their junior hockey tenure and are years behind their classmates with nothing to show for it, and these players may find it difficult in getting accepted into a college because colleges may not view the individual as a serious student; also if the player prospered as a student in high school, colleges may not even take into account high school grades and test scores if they solely use the player’s community college grades to make their decision. </p>
			<h5>Background Analysis</h5>
			<p>Since the movie Miracle was released in 2004, it has impacted hockey players from a very broad range of age groups. From players living their dream in their mid-twenties to children as young as five just embarking on the journey of finding and chasing a dream, this truly incredible underdog story sparks hope in the hearts of hockey players of any age that with hard work anything can be done. Miracle is the very unlikely story of how a team of players just out of college took down the best team in the world. In 1980, only amateurs could compete in the Olympics, and because of a flaw in the amateur categorization, some countries, such as the Soviet Union, were allowed to put together teams of “state sponsored ‘full-time amateur athletes’” that were essentially professionals (Olympics). The Soviets won gold in the four previous Olympics coming into 1980, and to just say they were the favorite would be a massive understatement. This Soviet team was known to be the best hockey team the world had to offer, especially after they beat the NHL all-star team by a score of 6-0. With this in mind, United States team of college players made the statement by beating the Soviets that through hard work and preparation, even what might seem to be impossible can happen.</p>
			<p>Even though Miracle illustrates a season for a team composed of the best college hockey players in America, hockey players of any level can see very strong correlations between the small events, issues, and successes depicted in this movie and those that occur on their team. The easiness for so many hockey players to relate to this movie is what has made Miracle such a strong inspiration for hockey players and a substantial piece of popular culture within the hockey community. Miracle gives a picture of the lifestyle hockey players live by showing the events that occur to any given team in a season. Most hockey players would agree these little things that come up during the season are as essential to the hockey experience as the nets, sticks, and pucks. These occurrences include camaraderie built between teammates, ups and downs, wins and losses, injuries, early morning practices, sore muscles, and evolving as a team throughout the season. All in all, this movie inspires players to go chase their goals and endorses playing college hockey as an admirable goal, and because the connections between the 1980 United States Olympic team and any hockey team are so close, goals such as playing college hockey and winning Olympic gold can almost seem to be within reach.</p>
			<h5>Description of the Issue</h5>
			<p>As previously stated, the road to playing college hockey requires the prospective athlete to take a detour from his educational goals in order to develop his skills. The choice for a player to play junior hockey commonly takes much thought and consideration. Because junior hockey is typically a time commitment of 3 years, this is quite a substantial life choice for a young individual to make, and a player usually needs strong support from his family to make this decision. In economic terms, the opportunity cost of playing junior hockey has many other explicit and implicit facets in addition to the time commitment. The player will eventually graduate college much later than his classmates. After years away from school the athlete may struggle with adapting to college classes and will need to relearn many things forgotten from high school. The player will not have all the resources available to him while applying to colleges as he had in high school (e.g. teachers to proofread papers and counselors). Taking at most limited college credits from community college may hurt the player’s chances of being accepted into college as college admission departments may perceive the individual as not committed to his education. If the player did well in high school and took community college classes after graduation, his high school grades may not even be a factor in his admission decision as many colleges define any student with college credit after high school as a transfer student instead of an incoming freshman, no matter what their standing is. Also, if the player took only a few community college classes, his limited credits will not be much to demonstrate his academic potential, and he will be up against many people trying to land the few transfer openings schools offer. Finally, the player may even choose to not attend college after junior hockey as he may be influenced by a poor choice many of his peers end up making.</p>
			<p>Another issue comes forth in NCAA eligibility requirements. A player has 5 years of eligibility to play an NCAA sport beginning the first semester he is enrolled in classes full time (Eligible). This gives junior hockey players one of two options: take time off of school or only take part time classes. Even if the player does choose to take classes, he is still falling behind as he is not allowed to take as many credits as full time students take. </p>
